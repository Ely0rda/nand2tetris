
How can I design the zx,zy,nx,xy,f,no?
    - demultiplexers
        The porblem is that the demux chips
        I have don't look appropriate for
        the ALU
    - Using basic gates
        The problem is I need to do a lot of 
        work
    - Using multiplexer 
        I have a good multiplexers for doing int
        Problem is that I will do all the calculation
        first and using the controlors I will chose
        which one to pass to the next step.
        I think this will make the ALU slow,because
        it is going to waste time on doing operation
        that I may not need, but this is my best
        bet for now, so let 's do it, then we can check
        if my implementation is the right one.



//negating logic
Not16(in=x,out=notx)
//zeroing x
we can take advantage of the notx calculate by
not 16

And16(a=x,b=notx,out=zero16);

//negating logic
